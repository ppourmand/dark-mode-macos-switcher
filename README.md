# Usage 
First run `chmod +x switcher.sh` on the script so you can run it.

Pass in the name of the application you want to exclude from dark mode (putting it in light mode) like so:

`./switcher.sh firefox light`

Or if you want to revert it back to dark

`./switcher.sh firefox dark`

# Warning
Restart the application to see it take effect

# Requirements
- Use bash 4 or newer
- Make sure system is already in dark mode
